"""
This script imports absence data from a CSV file into a Django database.
The script defines several functions to:
- Load data from a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.
- Process each row of the DataFrame to create or update AbsenceLog entries in the database.
- Handle potential errors during data processing.
- Track the number of records created and skipped.
The script uses Django's ORM and transaction management to ensure data integrity.
